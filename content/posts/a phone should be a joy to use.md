## INTRO

Smart phones are useful objects. They're telephones-calculators-text-processors-instant-messengers-web-browsers-etceteras. There is very little that you cannot do on a smartphone.  This is also why they suck. 

Time is money, and your attention is easily spent.  In a survey of a little over 4,000 individuals in 2024, the average screen time reported was [4 hours and 43 minutes](https://prioridata.com/data/smartphone-usage-statistics/). This is close to my own approximate usage. Sometimes I wonder where I even find the time in the day for it; I am sure that much of it is interstitial quick scrolls that quickly add up. I am also certainly guilty of doing social media+news catchups in the morning and blasting my eyes with delicious hyperblue screen light as soon as I wake up, which can only be very healthy for me both physically and emotionally. (What roulette of horrors shall the X for-you feed hold today?)

The inability to escape from the slough trough of social media is a mulched horse. Other people have written about it before me and better. I've enjoyed "[How the Devil Stole My Eyes](https://youngvulgarian.substack.com/p/how-the-devil-stole-my-eyes)" and a couple more articles that I'll come back and add here when I remember them.

But what can I do beyond just kvetching about it? How can I make my phone a tool, rather than a timesink? And how do I break my bad habits? (This problem in particular makes me think of the [Rat Park](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00431995) and its observations on environmental enrichment: would I want the sweet morphine-drip of social media if I had genuinely good things going on in my social life?)

## COLD TURKEY

I'm of two minds on filters, blockers, and dumb-phoneification.  It might be interesting [to toss my phone in a safe and see how I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsyGSTKlw0). But--! I use the thing to check my emails and DMs and see what's happening in the news and text my family and all of these things that I might not really need to do but I *like* doing them! And that's the problem. I enjoy all the possibilities that my phone has, the WWW in my pocket. It's the ensuing *distraction* that is the problem: picking up the thing to shoot a text to a friend on the other side of the world, and then going on the scroll-cycle of a half-dozen apps to see if there's anything I might be missing out on. The first sixty seconds or so after I pick up my phone are useful. It's the animal-pacing-around-its-enclosure activity that comes after that I resent.

For inexplicable reasons, I do not like the screen time management tools baked into IOS itself. I like using [Refocus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/refocus-app-blocker-limits/id1645639057) instead. It can be used for free. Subscription features include in-depth stats and configurable focus/strict modes. I feel no particular need to fuss around with those, so I use it as a freebie. I set up a blocking period from 6am to 9:30 pm.  I can un-block things for 15 minute intervals.

## FRICTION

I don't use social media on my phone via apps anymore. I try to exclusively use them via the browser, and I turn off infinite scrolling if given the option. Having to press "next page" each time I want a new platter of content makes me stop and think about if that's the best idea.

This also means that I don't get push notifications. I think it really depends on the person as to if push notifications are annoying or not; depending on how tuned-in you are, you might end up reflexively refreshing your activity page far more often than you would have if the phone forwarded that information to you. A semi-compromise is turning email notifications on, but that usually comes with an awful slew of promo content, so I generally do not opt for that.

## DULLNESS

I really love the new IOS tinted mode. I have seen people decide to fully enable grayscale mode on the phone, but I'd like to be able to see how my own photos look without going and changing my settings around.

To enable: Hold-tap on your home screen -> Upper left hand Edit menu -> Customize -> Tinted -> Choose a soothing color -> Voila, no red alert notification bubbles on things, and all your apps look nice and uniform. 

Unfortunately, the tint mode did not play nice with the widget-building apps I use, so I opted to instead replace many app icons with shortcuts that opened the app (and optionally logged the action into a json file for habit tracking.) Since it's a shortcut icon and not the app itself, it can't have notification bubbles, and you can make the icon whatever picture you want, so it can all be very aesthetically pleasing.
