          <h2 id="intro">INTRO</h2>
<p>Smart phones are useful objects. They&rsquo;re telephones-calculators-text-processors-instant-messengers-web-browsers-etceteras. There is very little that you cannot do on a smartphone.  This is also why they suck.</p>
<p>Time is money, and your attention is easily spent.  In a survey of a little over 4,000 individuals in 2024, the average screen time reported was <a href="https://prioridata.com/data/smartphone-usage-statistics/">4 hours and 43 minutes</a>. This is close to my own approximate usage. Sometimes I wonder where I even find the time in the day for it; I am sure that much of it is interstitial quick scrolls that quickly add up. I am also certainly guilty of doing social media+news catchups in the morning and blasting my eyes with delicious hyperblue screen light as soon as I wake up, which can only be very healthy for me both physically and emotionally. (What roulette of horrors shall the X for-you feed hold today?)</p>
<p>The inability to escape from the slough trough of social media is a mulched horse. Other people have written about it before me and better. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed &ldquo;<a href="https://youngvulgarian.substack.com/p/how-the-devil-stole-my-eyes">How the Devil Stole My Eyes</a>&rdquo; and a couple more articles that I&rsquo;ll come back and add here when I remember them.</p>
<p>But what can I do beyond just kvetching about it? How can I make my phone a tool, rather than a timesink? And how do I break my bad habits? This problem makes me think of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00431995">Rat Park</a> and its observations on environmental enrichment: would I want the sweet morphine-drip of social media if I had genuinely good things going on in my social life?</p>
<h2 id="cold-turkey">COLD TURKEY</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m of two minds on filters, blockers, and dumb-phoneification.  It might be interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsyGSTKlw0">to toss my phone in a safe and see how I do</a>. But&ndash;! I use the thing to check my emails and DMs and see what&rsquo;s happening in the news and text my family and all of these things that I might not really need to do but I <em>like</em> doing them! And that&rsquo;s the problem. I enjoy all the possibilities that my phone has, the WWW in my pocket. It&rsquo;s the ensuing <em>distraction</em> that is the problem: picking up the thing to shoot a text to a friend on the other side of the world, and then going on the scroll-cycle of a half-dozen apps to see if there&rsquo;s anything I might be missing out on. The first sixty seconds or so after I pick up my phone are useful. It&rsquo;s the animal-pacing-around-its-enclosure activity that comes after that is the problem.</p>
<p>For inexplicable reasons, I do not like the screen time management tools baked into IOS itself. I like using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/refocus-app-blocker-limits/id1645639057">Refocus</a> instead. It can be used for free. Subscription features include in-depth stats and configurable focus/strict modes. I feel no particular need to fuss around with those, so I use it as a freebie. I set up a blocking period from 6am to 9:30 pm.  I can un-block things for 15 minute intervals.</p>
<h2 id="friction">FRICTION</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use social media on my phone via apps anymore. I try to exclusively use them via the browser, and I turn off infinite scrolling if given the option. Having to press &ldquo;next page&rdquo; each time I want a new platter of content makes me stop and think about if that&rsquo;s the best idea.</p>
<p>This also means that I don&rsquo;t get push notifications. I think it really depends on the person as to if push notifications are annoying or not; depending on how tuned-in you are, you might end up reflexively refreshing your activity page far more often than you would have if the phone forwarded that information to you. A semi-compromise is turning email notifications on, but that usually comes with an awful slew of promo content so I generally do not opt for that.</p>
<h2 id="dullness">DULLNESS</h2>
<p>I really love the new IOS tinted mode. I have seen people decide to fully enable grayscale mode on the phone, but I&rsquo;d like to be able to see how my own photos look without going and changing my settings around.</p>
<p>To enable: Hold-tap on your home screen -&gt; Upper left hand Edit menu -&gt; Customize -&gt; Tinted -&gt; Choose a soothing color -&gt; Voila, no red alert notification bubbles on things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tint mode did not play nice with the widget-building apps I use, so I opted to instead replace many app icons with shortcuts that opened the app (and optionally logged the action into a json file for habit tracking.) Since it&rsquo;s a shortcut icon and not the app itself, it can&rsquo;t have notification bubbles, and you can make the icon whatever picture you want, so it can all be very aesthetic.</p>
