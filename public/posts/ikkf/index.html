          <p><a href="/IKKF.html">IKKF</a>: An RSVP reader with extra features such as capturing highlights and taking notes. This tool is meant to be usable both online and offline. CSS/HTML/Javascript are all on the page&ndash; if you want, you can save it and use it on your own.</p>
<p>RSVP, or rapid serial visual presentation, is a method of speedreading where the words are displayed on the screen one at a time for a set amount of milliseconds. I like it. I think it&rsquo;s good for getting through the news, with larger &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; (more than one word at a time) preferable for denser prose. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it, of course, if you&rsquo;re looking forward to luxuriating in Literature, but it is good for just getting the reading done.</p>
<p>I like taking notes as I read, and in most RSVP programs I&rsquo;ve tried, if I wanted to directly quote the text, then I would have to go search for the string in the source and copy it out. So, I made this tool to add more notetaking/highlighting functionalities on top of the existing RSVP method.</p>
<p>I am a big amateur so the code in this is probably not as clean as it could be. A lot of it is very miscellaneous copypaste, but if any functions are directly lifted from somewhere, I have a comment with the source.</p>
<p>Other cool RSVP projects: <a href="https://hotgato.com/">Hot Gato</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stutter/reviews/?utm_source=firefox-browser&amp;utm_medium=firefox-browser&amp;utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link">Stutter Firefox addon</a></p>
