      <description>I like Neocities. Unfortunately, I am also lazy, and the (admittedly minimal) sequence of operations needed to upkeep Zonelets + ZoneRSS had me wondering if things could be easier.&#xA;4rkal has a fantastic guide for publishing an Obsidian vault to a website via Hugo, a Github repo, and Render, and this guide was pretty much all I needed, save for a few adjustments.&#xA;Obsidian is packed with features, which also leads to it having a reputation for a high learning curve; to either my own advantage or detriment, I hardly use any of them.</description>

      <description>IKKF: An RSVP reader with extra features such as capturing highlights and taking notes. This tool is meant to be usable both online and offline. CSS/HTML/Javascript are all on the page&amp;ndash; if you want, you can save it and use it on your own.&#xA;RSVP, or rapid serial visual presentation, is a method of speedreading where the words are displayed on the screen one at a time for a set amount of milliseconds.</description>
