      <description>IKKF: An RSVP reader with extra features such as capturing highlights and taking notes. This tool is meant to be usable both online and offline. CSS/HTML/Javascript are all on the page&amp;ndash; if you want, you can save it and use it on your own.&#xA;RSVP, or rapid serial visual presentation, is a method of speedreading where the words are displayed on the screen one at a time for a set amount of milliseconds.</description>

      <description>I am not a personable person. I also cannot speak French, operate a forklift, or bench press five hundred pounds. These are not unattainable, solely innate gifts that I lack; they are skills I can learn. (Some would take more time, effort, and steroids to succeed at than others.)&#xA;The purpose of this site is to collate and reinforce information that I gather about living socially, as well as to allow myself to develop my own opinions on how to use it as I learn.</description>
